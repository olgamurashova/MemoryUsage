## Memory Usage

### General information

We want the program in memoryUsage.js to store the starting amount of memory used (heapUsed), perform an operation, and then compare the final amount of memory used to the original amount. The  initialMemory variable is assigned to null. After changing this line, initialMemory is instead assigned the value of the heapUsed property on the object returned from invoking the process.memoryUsage() method.

### Tools used:
